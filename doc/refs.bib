  abstract  = {The identification of genomic rearrangements, particularly in cancers, with high sensitivity and specificity using massively parallel sequencing remains a major challenge. Here, we describe the Genome Rearrangement IDentification Software Suite (GRIDSS), a high-speed structural variant (SV) caller that performs efficient genome-wide break-end assembly prior to variant calling using a novel positional de Bruijn graph assembler. By combining assembly, split read and read pair evidence using a probabilistic scoring, GRIDSS achieves high sensitivity and specificity on simulated, cell line and patient tumour data, recently winning SV sub-challenge $\#$5 of the ICGC-TCGA DREAM Somatic Mutation Calling Challenge. On human cell line data, GRIDSS halves the false discovery rate compared to other recent methods. GRIDSS identifies non-template sequence insertions, micro-homologies and large imperfect homologies, and supports multi-sample analysis. GRIDSS is freely available at https://github.com/PapenfussLab/gridss.},

  abstract        = {In the last several years, a number of studies have described large-scale structural variation in several genomes. Traditionally, such methods have used whole-genome array comparative genome hybridization or single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays to detect large regions subject to copy-number variation. Later techniques have been based on paired-end mapping of Sanger sequencing data, providing better resolution and accuracy. With the advent of next-generation sequencing, a new generation of methods is being developed to tackle the challenges of short reads, while taking advantage of the high coverage the new sequencing technologies provide. In this survey, we describe these methods, including their strengths and their limitations, and future research directions.},

  abstract        = {From prokaryotes to eukaryotes, phenotypic variation, adaptation and speciation has been associated with structural variation between genomes of individuals within the same species. Many computer algorithms detecting such variations (callers) have recently been developed, spurred by the advent of the next-generation sequencing technology. Such callers mainly exploit split-read mapping or paired-end read mapping. However, as different callers are geared towards different types of structural variation, there is still no single caller that can be considered a community standard; instead, increasingly the various callers are combined in integrated pipelines. In this article, we review a wide range of callers, discuss challenges in the integration step and present a survey of pipelines used in population genomics studies. Based on our findings, we provide general recommendations on how to set-up such pipelines. Finally, we present an outlook on future challenges in structural variation detection.},

The detection of mobile elements is hindered due to the low mappability of their highly repetitive sequences. We have developed an algorithm, called Mobster, to detect non-reference mobile element insertions in next generation sequencing data from both whole genome and whole exome studies. Mobster uses discordant read pairs and clipped reads in combination with consensus sequences of known active mobile elements. Mobster has a low false discovery rateand high recall rate for both L1 and Alu elements. Mobster is available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/mobster.},
